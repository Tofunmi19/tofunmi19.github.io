  <p>Hi! I am Tofunmi and I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University. Here I work in the Daneshjou and Zaba Labs under the departments of Dermatology and Biomedical Data Science. Specifically, I work at the nexus of artificial intelligence, healthcare, and policy. My research covers computer vision, foundation models, and AI bias. Some of my projects have been published in journals like Nature Digital Medicine and featured in media outlets like the Washington Post and AP news.
    <br><br>
Before Stanford, I earned my medical degree from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, where I was privileged to be a Federal Govt. and Shell University Scholar. I later pursued an MS in Health Policy at Stanford while focusing on AI and working in a surgery-AI lab. Here, I explored the utility of machine learning algorithms in clinical settings and how macroeconomic policies influence mortality.
    <br><br>
I have collaborated on global health projects with the WHO and Gates foundation, and have also had a stint in venture capital supporting early stage investments in the SF Bay Area. I also started a non-profit in Nigeria. I am deeply passionate about ensuring AI benefits all patients, especially underserved populations. In my spare time, I enjoy concerts, Afrobeats, Tennis, and the real Football. I also enjoy hanging out in the Bay Area. 
Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, talks, or consulting.
